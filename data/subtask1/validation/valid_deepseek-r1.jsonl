For example:\n   - In the bottom-left block, block all cells except row \\(m-1\\),\n   - In the middle block, block all cells except column \\(2m-1\\),\n   - In the top-right block, block all cells except row \\(2m\\).\n4. **Cell Count**: Each diagonal block contributes \\(m^2 - m\\) blocked cells (subtracting the \\(m\\) unblocked cells). Total blocked cells: \\(3(m^2 - m) = 3m^2 - 3m\\).\n5. **Minimality**: Each blocked cell is necessary to block paths passing through its respective diagonal block, ensuring minimality.\n\n### Part (b): Upper Bound of \\(3m^2\\) Cells for Minimal Blocking Sets\n\n1. **Row and Column Analysis**: Assume a minimal blocking set \\(X\\). If any row contains more than \\(m\\) blocked cells, removing one would still leave \\(m\\) blocked cells, contradicting minimality.\n2. **Maximal Blocking per Row**: Each row can have at most \\(m\\) blocked cells. With \\(3m\\) rows, total cells are bounded by \\(3m \\cdot m = 3m^2\\).\n3. **Generalization**: Symmetrically, columns also imply the same bound. Thus, no minimal blocking set exceeds \\(3m^2\\) cells without redundancy.\n\nBoth results rely on systematic grid division and combinatorial bounds, ensuring the existence and maximal size of minimal blocking sets.", "generator": "llm", "detailed_generator": "deepseek-r1"}

The goal is to compute \\(100c + d\\).\n\n### Analysis of the first equation\nThe equation \\(\\frac{(x+c)(x+d)(x+8)}{(x+2)^2} = 0\\) is satisfied when the numerator is zero and the denominator is non-zero. The numerator \\((x+c)(x+d)(x+8) = 0\\) has roots at \\(x = -c\\), \\(-d\\), and \\(-8\\). The denominator is zero at \\(x = -2\\), so for the fraction to be defined and zero at these roots, \\(x = -2\\) must not be a root of the numerator, and the roots must be distinct.\n\nThus, the conditions are:\n- \\(-c\\), \\(-d\\), and \\(-8\\) are distinct.\n- None of \\(-c\\), \\(-d\\), \\(-8\\) equals \\(-2\\), which implies \\(c \\neq 2\\), \\(d \\neq 2\\), and \\(8 \\neq 2\\) (always true).\n- The distinctness implies \\(c \\neq d\\), \\(c \\neq 8\\), and \\(d \\neq 8\\).\n\nIn summary, \\(c\\), \\(d\\), and \\(8\\) are distinct, and none is equal to \\(2\\).\n\n### Analysis of the second equation\nThe equation \\(\\frac{(x+3c)(x+2)(x+4)}{(x+d)(x+8)} = 0\\) is satisfied when the numerator is zero and the denominator is non-zero. The numerator \\((x+3c)(x+2)(x+4) = 0\\) has roots at \\(x = -3c\\), \\(-2\\), and \\(-4\\). The denominator is zero at \\(x = -d\\) and \\(x = -8\\).\n\nThe roots of the fraction are the roots of the numerator that are not roots of the denominator. For exactly one distinct root to exist for the fraction, exactly one distinct root of the numerator must not be a root of the denominator. This requires that two of the numerator roots are roots of the denominator (ensuring they are invalid), and the third is not (ensuring it is valid). Thus, the set \\(\\{-d, -8\\}\\) must be a subset of the set \\(\\{-3c, -2, -4\\}\\), and the set \\(\\{-3c, -2, -4\\}\\) must have exactly three distinct elements (to ensure exactly one valid root remains).\n\nThe distinctness condition requires:\n- \\(-3c \\neq -2\\) ⇒ \\(c \\neq \\frac{2}{3}\\),\n- \\(-3c \\neq -4\\) ⇒ \\(c \\neq \\frac{4}{3}\\),\n- \\(-2 \\neq -4\\) (always true).\n\nNow, \\(\\{-d, -8\\} \\subseteq \\{-3c, -2, -4\\}\\). Since \\(-d\\) and \\(-8\\) are distinct (as \\(d \\neq 8\\) from the first equation), and \\(-8 \\neq -2\\), \\(-8 \\neq -4\\), the only possibility is \\(-8 = -3c\\), so \\(c = \\frac{8}{3}\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(c = \\frac{8}{3}\\):\n- The set is \\(\\{-3 \\cdot \\frac{8}{3}, -2, -4\\} = \\{-8, -2, -4\\}\\), which has three distinct elements.\n- Now, \\(\\{-d, -8\\} \\subseteq \\{-8, -2, -4\\}\\), so \\(-d\\) must be \\(-2\\) or \\(-4\\).\n\nThus, \\(d = 2\\) or \\(d = 4\\). However, from the first equation, \\(d \\neq 2\\), so \\(d = 4\\).\n\n### Verification\nWith \\(c = \\frac{8}{3}\\) and \\(d = 4\\):\n- First equation numerator: \\(\\left(x + \\frac{8}{3}\\right)(x + 4)(x + 8)\\), roots at \\(x = -\\frac{8}{3}\\), \\(-4\\), \\(-8\\), all distinct. Denominator zero at \\(x = -2\\), which is not a root, so three distinct roots: \\(x = -\\frac{8}{3}\\), \\(-4\\), \\(-8\\).\n- Second equation numerator: \\(\\left(x + 3 \\cdot \\frac{8}{3}\\right)(x + 2)(x + 4) = (x + 8)(x + 2)(x + 4)\\), roots at \\(x = -8\\), \\(-2\\), \\(-4\\). Denominator: \\((x + 4)(x + 8)\\), zero at \\(x = -4\\), \\(-8\\). The fraction simplifies to \\(x + 2\\) for \\(x \\neq -4, -8\\), so zero at \\(x = -2\\) (defined), and no other roots. Thus, exactly one distinct root.\n\n### Uniqueness\nOther possibilities were considered:\n- If \\(c = \\frac{2}{3}\\), the numerator of the second equation has roots at \\(x = -2\\) (multiplicity 2) and \\(x = -4\\), but \\(\\{-d, -8\\} \\subseteq \\{-2, -4\\}\\) is impossible since \\(-8\\) is not in the set.\n- If \\(c = \\frac{4}{3}\\), similar issue occurs.\n- If \\(d = 2\\) (with \\(c = \\frac{8}{3}\\)), the first equation has only two valid roots, violating the condition.\nThus, \\(c = \\frac{8}{3}\\), \\(d = 4\\) is the unique solution.\n\n### Computation\n\\(100c + d = 100 \\cdot \\frac{8}{3} + 4 = \\frac{800}{3} + \\frac{12}{3} = \\frac{812}{3}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{812}{3}}", "generator": "llm", "detailed_generator": "deepseek-r1"}

Specifically, the equation \\(L^2 V^2 = R^2 U^2\\) may hold, but \\(L V = R U\\) (required for equal angles) does not, or the solutions imply \\(y_b = 0\\), which is degenerate.

This is equivalent to showing that for any set of 502 integers, there exist two distinct elements \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(a \\equiv b \\pmod{1000}\\) or \\(a \\equiv -b \\pmod{1000}\\).\n\nConsider the residues of the numbers modulo 1000. The residues range from 0 to 999, and there are 1000 possible residues. If any two numbers have the same residue modulo 1000, then \\(a \\equiv b \\pmod{1000}\\), so their difference is divisible by 1000, and the condition is satisfied. Thus, the critical case is when all residues are distinct, as duplicates immediately satisfy the condition.\n\nAssume that all 502 residues are distinct modulo 1000. It remains to show that there exist two distinct residues \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(a \\equiv -b \\pmod{1000}\\), meaning \\(a + b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{1000}\\), so their sum is divisible by 1000.\n\nThe residues modulo 1000 can be analyzed under negation. A residue \\(r\\) satisfies \\(r \\equiv -r \\pmod{1000}\\) if and only if \\(2r \\equiv 0 \\pmod{1000}\\), which simplifies to \\(r \\equiv 0 \\pmod{500}\\) since \\(\\gcd(2, 1000) = 2\\). Thus, the fixed points of negation are \\(r = 0\\) and \\(r = 500\\). For all other residues, \\(r\\) and \\(-r \\equiv 1000 - r \\pmod{1000}\\) are distinct, and they form unordered pairs \\(\\{r, -r\\}\\) where \\(r \\not\\equiv -r \\pmod{1000}\\).\n\nThere are 1000 residues. The two fixed points (0 and 500) are singletons. The remaining 998 residues form \\(998 / 2 = 499\\) pairs, each containing two distinct elements that are negatives modulo 1000.\n\nA subset of residues with no two elements satisfying \\(a \\equiv b \\pmod{1000}\\) or \\(a \\equiv -b \\pmod{1000}\\) must contain at most one element from each pair \\(\\{r, -r\\}\\) and can include the fixed points. The maximum size of such a subset is the number of pairs plus the number of fixed points: \\(499 + 2 = 501\\). For example, the set \\(\\{0, 500\\} \\cup \\{1, 2, \\dots, 499\\}\\) has 501 elements and satisfies the condition: no two are congruent modulo 1000 (since residues are distinct), and no two are negatives modulo 1000 (as each pair \\(\\{k, 1000 - k\\}\\) for \\(1 \\leq k \\leq 499\\) contains only one element, and the fixed points have no distinct negative partner).\n\nWith 502 distinct residues, which exceeds this maximum size of 501, it is impossible to avoid having both elements of some pair \\(\\{r, -r\\}\\) in the set. If both \\(r\\) and \\(-r\\) are in the set, then for \\(a = r\\) and \\(b = -r\\), \\(a \\equiv -b \\pmod{1000}\\) since \\(-b \\equiv -(-r) \\equiv r \\equiv a \\pmod{1000}\\), and \\(a \\neq b\\). Thus, \\(a + b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{1000}\\), so their sum is divisible by 1000.\n\nTherefore, for any set of 502 natural numbers, if residues are not all distinct, duplicates ensure a pair with difference divisible by 1000; if residues are distinct, the pigeonhole principle ensures a pair with sum divisible by 1000. Hence, there are always two numbers such that their difference or sum is divisible by 1000.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{\\text{true}}", "generator": "llm", "detailed_generator": "deepseek-r1"}

One day, these 2022 hamsters form a circle, and each hamster says: \"Both hamsters adjacent to me are lying!\" What is the maximum number of hamsters that could be telling the truth?", "solution": "The problem involves 2022 hamsters arranged in a circle, each either always telling the truth (T) or always lying (L). Each hamster claims that both adjacent hamsters are lying. The goal is to maximize the number of truth-tellers.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Constraints from Truth-Tellers (T):**  \n   If a hamster is a truth-teller, their statement \"both adjacent hamsters are lying\" must be true. Thus, both neighbors must be liars (L).  \n   Therefore, **no two truth-tellers can be adjacent**.\n\n2. **Constraints from Liars (L):**  \n   If a hamster is a liar, their statement \"both adjacent hamsters are lying\" must be false. This means that at least one adjacent hamster is a truth-teller (since if both were liars, the statement would be true, contradicting the liar's nature).  \n   Therefore, **no liar can have two liar neighbors**; each liar must have at least one truth-telling neighbor.\n\n### Pattern Analysis:\n- **Blocks of Liars:**  \n  The constraints imply that consecutive liars must form blocks of size 1 or 2:  \n  - A single liar (L) must be flanked by truth-tellers (T) on both sides (e.g., T-L-T).  \n  - A pair of liars (L-L) must be flanked by truth-tellers (e.g., T-L-L-T), with each liar in the pair having exactly one truth-telling neighbor.  \n  Blocks larger than 2 are impossible because an internal liar in a block of size ≥3 would have two liar neighbors, violating the liar constraint.\n\n- **Gaps Between Truth-Tellers:**  \n  Let \\(m\\) be the number of truth-tellers. Since the hamsters form a circle, there are \\(m\\) gaps between the truth-tellers. Each gap contains a block of liars of size \\(k_i\\), where \\(k_i = 1\\) or \\(2\\) for each \\(i = 1, \\dots, m\\).  \n  The total number of liars is \\(s = \\sum_{i=1}^m k_i\\).  \n  The total number of hamsters is \\(n = m + s\\).\n\n### Bounds on \\(m\\):\n- Since each \\(k_i \\geq 1\\), \\(s \\geq m\\), so \\(n = m + s \\geq m + m = 2m\\), implying \\(m \\leq \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor\\).  \n- Since each \\(k_i \\leq 2\\), \\(s \\leq 2m\\), so \\(n = m + s \\leq m + 2m = 3m\\), implying \\(m \\geq \\lceil n/3 \\rceil\\).  \nTo maximize \\(m\\), we minimize \\(s\\), which occurs when all \\(k_i = 1\\) (i.e., all gaps have exactly one liar). This gives \\(s = m\\) and \\(n = 2m\\), so \\(m = n/2\\).  \nThis requires \\(n\\) even, as \\(n/2\\) must be an integer.\n\n### Case for \\(n = 2022\\):\n- \\(n = 2022\\) is even, so \\(m = n/2 = 1011\\) is achievable.  \n- The configuration is alternating truth-tellers and liars: T, L, T, L, ..., T, L.  \n  - Each truth-teller has two liar neighbors, so their statement is true.  \n  - Each liar has two truth-teller neighbors, so \"both adjacent are lying\" is false (since both are truth-telling), and the liar lies correctly.  \n- Since \\(m \\leq \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor = 1011\\) and this bound is achieved, 1011 is the maximum.\n\n### Uniqueness of Maximum:\n- For even \\(n\\), the maximum \\(m = n/2\\) is unique to the alternating pattern (up to rotation and reflection), as any deviation (e.g., a gap with two liars) reduces \\(m\\) below \\(n/2\\).  \n- For example, with \\(n = 4\\), only T-L-T-L works; T-L-L-T is impossible due to adjacent truth-tellers.  \n- Thus, for \\(n = 2022\\), the maximum of 1011 is unique.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{1011}", "generator": "llm", "detailed_generator": "deepseek-r1"}

First, to show that for a continuous distribution function \\(F\\), the support \\(\\text{supp } F\\) is a perfect set and equals the set of growth points \\(G_F\\). Second, to provide an example of a discrete distribution function with support \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n\n### Part 1: Support of Continuous Distribution Function\nLet \\(F\\) be a continuous distribution function on \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), and let \\(\\mu\\) be the corresponding probability measure. The support \\(\\text{supp } F\\) is defined as the smallest closed set \\(S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}\\) such that \\(\\mu(\\mathbb{R} \\setminus S) = 0\\). Equivalently, as established in measure theory, \\(\\text{supp } F = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid \\mu(U) > 0 \\text{ for every open neighborhood } U \\text{ of } x \\}\\), which is precisely the set \\(G_F\\) of growth points of \\(F\\).\n\nTo show \\(\\text{supp } F\\) is perfect (closed and has no isolated points):\n- \\(\\text{supp } F\\) is closed by definition.\n- Suppose, for contradiction, that \\(\\text{supp } F\\) has an isolated point \\(a\\). Since \\(a\\) is isolated, there exists an open neighborhood \\(U\\) of \\(a\\) such that \\(U \\cap \\text{supp } F = \\{a\\}\\). Because \\(F\\) is continuous, \\(\\mu\\) is atomless, so \\(\\mu(\\{a\\}) = 0\\). Then, \\(\\text{supp } F \\setminus \\{a\\}\\) is closed (as \\(a\\) is isolated), and \\(\\mu(\\text{supp } F \\setminus \\{a\\}) = \\mu(\\text{supp } F) = 1\\) since \\(\\mu(\\{a\\}) = 0\\). However, \\(\\text{supp } F \\setminus \\{a\\}\\) is a closed set with full measure strictly smaller than \\(\\text{supp } F\\), contradicting the minimality of \\(\\text{supp } F\\). Thus, \\(\\text{supp } F\\) has no isolated points and is perfect.\n\nMoreover, \\(\\text{supp } F = G_F\\), as both sets consist of points where every neighborhood has positive measure.\n\n### Part 2: Example of Discrete Distribution with Support \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)\nA discrete distribution is concentrated on a countable set. For \\(\\text{supp } F = \\mathbb{R}\\), the set of atoms must be dense in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). Let the atoms be the rational numbers \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), enumerated as \\(\\{q_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\). Define a probability measure \\(\\mu\\) by:\n\\[\n\\mu(\\{q_n\\}) = \\frac{1}{2^n} \\quad \\text{for each } n.\n\\]\nSince \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^n} = 1\\), this is a valid probability measure. The set of atoms is \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), which is dense in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). The support \\(\\text{supp } F\\) is the smallest closed set containing all atoms. As \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is dense in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), the closure of \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). Any closed set containing all atoms must contain \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), so \\(\\text{supp } F = \\mathbb{R}\\).\n\nThe distribution function \\(F(x) = \\mu((-\\infty, x]) = \\sum_{q_n \\leq x} \\frac{1}{2^n}\\) is discrete because it is constant between atoms and has jumps at each rational, satisfying the requirement.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{F(x) = \\sum_{q_n \\leq x} \\frac{1}{2^n} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad \\{q_n\\} = \\mathbb{Q}}", "generator": "llm", "detailed_generator": "deepseek-r1"}
